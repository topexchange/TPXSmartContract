# Compiling and Running
## Preparations

Install the needed components:
- Truffle
- Test RPC

```
$ npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
$ npm install -g truffle
```

## Add Node modules
initialize all node components by doing node install
```
$ make init
```

## Compile

Compiling can be done as:
```
$ make
```

## Migrate the Contracts

To migrate the contract, run test RPC on a separate console, and do `make rpc`. Then run `make migrate` to migrate the contracts to the development network.
```
$ make rpc
$ make migrate
```

You should see something similar to below:
```
$ make migrate
truffle migrate --network development
Using network 'development'.
